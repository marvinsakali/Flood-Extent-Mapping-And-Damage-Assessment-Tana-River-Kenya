# Flood-Extent-Mapping-And-Damage-Assessment-Tana-River-Kenya
## Abstract

Kenya experienced severe flooding between mid-April and May 2024, resulting in loss of life, property damage, and displacement. This disaster was driven by continuous rainfall and river and dam overflows (OCHA, 2024).

To analyze the flood extent along the Tana River, one of the impacted regions, I utilized  Sentinel-1 images from April. These images were pre-processed and analyzed to delineate the flood extent and identify permanent water bodies, using the Global Surface Water. A preliminary damage assessment was conducted by integrating the flood extent layer with land cover data . The flood mapping and damage assessment were performed using Google Earth Engine's javascript API , and the resulting layers were exported to QGIS for final map creation.

The analysis revealed that shrubland and cropland were the most affected land cover types. These findings highlight the flood's substantial impact on local communities, including displacement, loss of livelihoods and biodiversity, and disruption of economic activities.
This study underscores the utility of GIS technologies for rapid disaster response and planning, leveraging freely available datasets. Geospatial technologies play a vital role in disaster management by providing timely information about affected populations and land cover, aiding in search and rescue operations, and supporting effective post-disaster compensation and assistance.
